# test_game_starter

This repository contains a starter setup for the procedural RPG described in
`design.md`. To prepare a development environment on Windows run:

```bat
scripts\setup.bat
```

The script creates a Python virtual environment, ensures the base folder
structure (`src`, `scripts`, `docs`, `config`) exists and installs dependencies
from `requirements.txt`.
