# UI Inventory and Menu Screens

Placeholders for Godot scenes will live in the `assets/ui` folder. The main menu
and inventory scenes will be created in Godot and hooked up to the Player
inventory. Until automated UI tests are available, open the project in Godot and
verify that the inventory screen lists items added to the player's inventory.
