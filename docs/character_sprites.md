# Character Sprite System

`character_sprites` builds a simple character appearance from the
`roguelike-characters` asset pack. It reads the asset index generated by
`asset_manager` and selects random layers.

```python
from character_sprites import generate_character

char = generate_character()
print(char.body)
```

Each returned `CharacterSprite` contains the chosen file names for `body`,
`eyes`, `hair` and `clothes`. These file names correspond to entries in
`assets/asset_index.json`.
